it's me, hi 👀💖

my name is drew. 🐻 i started coding blog themes and pages back in 20213 on tumblr. i taught myself through trial and error with the mindset that if it works, it works. most of my designs are minimalistic in nature and if it isn't obvious, i like pink a lot so most of my works' main accent color is pink euhehe. anyways - thank you for dropping by my github. 🪻 i hope you find what you're looking for.
